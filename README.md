#  AWS Cloud Quest – Cloud Practitioner Journey

##  Overview
This repository documents my hands-on journey through **AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner**,  
an interactive game-based learning challenge from AWS.  
The game provides practical, scenario-based labs to strengthen cloud computing skills.

I enrolled in this program through my **[AWS Skill Builder account](https://skillbuilder.aws/)**,  
and the Cloud Quest gaming course is available here: **[AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/11457/aws-cloud-quest-cloud-practitioner)**

##  What is AWS Cloud Quest?
- A role-based learning game where players help a digital city by solving cloud challenges.
- Each challenge represents a real AWS task, e.g., deploying S3 websites, configuring EC2, etc.
- Builds both **technical hands-on experience** and **problem-solving skills**.

##  What I’ll Learn
By completing Cloud Quest tasks, I will gain:
- Understanding of **AWS core services** (S3, EC2, IAM, VPC, etc.)
- Skills in **deploying cloud-based solutions**
- Experience with **scalable and secure architectures**
- Ability to translate real-world business needs into cloud solutions

#  AWS Cloud Quest – Cloud Practitioner Journey

##  Overview
This repository documents my hands-on journey through **AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner**,  
an interactive game-based learning challenge from AWS.  
The game provides practical, scenario-based labs to strengthen cloud computing skills.

I enrolled in this program through my **[AWS Skill Builder account](https://skillbuilder.aws/)**,  
and the Cloud Quest gaming course is available here: [AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/11457/aws-cloud-quest-cloud-practitioner)
